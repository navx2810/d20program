D20 Campaign Manager
==========

This program is meant to be used to track a D&D Campaign. It will allow the player to track basic information
such as characters, inventory, and campaign logs that hold dialog and short descriptions of what has occured.

#Planned features
* a full character sheet
* modules for different rulesets (4.0, 3.5, Pathfinder. . .)
* networked-features that allow some sort-of 'Sync' ability for players.


# Uses

The program will run as a standalone .JAR file which can be run with java. The program will also save a condesned
file that will hold characters + inventories, chat logs, dice rolls, everything. This will enable players to easilly
upload a file to some location to easilly share the files.
 could even add some kind of 'merger' feature which will compare two files to update them into one file.
